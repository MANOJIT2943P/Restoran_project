Introduction:
The Restaurant Management System is designed to streamline and automate the day-to-day operations of a restaurant. The primary objective of the system is to simplify the management of customer orders, inventory, billing, and staff coordination, improving overall efficiency and enhancing the dining experience.
This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution that will manage various aspects of restaurant operations, including order placement, kitchen management, and payment processing. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for restaurant staff to handle orders efficiently and for customers to receive quick and accurate service.
Key features of the system include menu management, table reservation, real-time order tracking, inventory management, and report generation.
By leveraging this system, restaurant owners will be able to minimize manual errors, reduce operational costs, and optimize staff performance, leading to improved customer satisfaction and profitability.
This document outlines the detailed requirements, specifications, and functionalities of the system to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project's scope and objectives.

COCOMO Model:
The COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is used to estimate the effort, development time, and cost of software projects. Based on your project being classified as an "organic" type and having an estimated 4000 Lines of Code (LOC), we can use the basic COCOMO model formula for an organic project.
COCOMO Basic Model Formulas:

Effort (Person-Months): 𝐸 = 𝑎 × (𝐾𝐿𝑂𝐶)𝑏

where: E = effort in person-months KLOC = thousands of lines of code (4000 LOC = 4 KLOC) a and b are constants that depend on the type of project.

Development Time (Months): 𝑇 = 𝑐 × (𝐸)𝑑

where: T = time to develop the software in months c and d are constants based on the type of project.
For an organic type project, the standard constants are: • a = 2.4 • b = 1.05 • c = 2.5
• d = 0.38
Step 1: Calculate Effort (E): 𝐸 = 2.4 × (4)1.05 𝐸 ≈ 2.4 × 4.28 ≈ 10.27 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛 − 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ
Step 2: Calculate Development Time (T): 𝑇 = 2.5 × (10.27)0.38 𝑇 ≈ 2.5 × 2.24 ≈ 5.6 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑠
Step 3: Calculate Number of People Needed (P): The average number of people required for the project can be found by dividing the effort by the development time: 𝐸 𝑃 = 𝑇 10.27
𝑃 =
5.6
≈ 1.83 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛
Summary of COCOMO Estimation: • Effort: ~10.27 person-months • Development Time: ~5.6 months • Average Team Size: ~1.83 persons (approximately 2 people)
This means our restaurant management project would take around 5.6 months with an average of 2 developers, and it would require a total effort of 10.27 person-months to complete.

Acknowledgement:
We, the project team, would like to express our sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to the successful completion of this Restaurant Management System project. First and foremost, we would like to thank our college, Gargi Memorial Institute of Technology for providing us with the opportunity and platform to work on this project, which has significantly enhanced our knowledge and skills in software development. We are deeply grateful to our Project Guide, Somnath Barik Sir, for their continuous guidance, valuable insights, and constructive feedback throughout the duration of this project. Their expertise and mentorship have been instrumental in shaping the direction and outcome of our work. We would also like to acknowledge the support and encouragement from the faculty and staff members of the Computer Science and Engineering department whose advice and technical assistance were pivotal at various stages of our project. Additionally, we extend our appreciation to our family and friends for their understanding and support during the project timeline.
Last but not least, we are thankful for the collaborative efforts of our team members, Debanjan Roy, Sougata manna, Suman Baral, Manojit Saha for their dedication, hard work, and teamwork. Without their commitment and enthusiasm, this project would not have been possible.
Thank you to all who played a part in making this project a success.
